It was invented around 1810 in the town of Altenburg, about 40km south of Leipzig, Germany, by the members of the Brommesche Tarok-Gesellschaft. They adapted the existing local game Schafkopfby adding features of the then popular games Tarok and l'Hombre. Altenburg is still considered the home of Skat and has a fountain dedicated to the game. Skat is a three-handed trick taking game. It is also quite often played by four people, but there arestill only 3 active players in each hand; the dealer sits out. Each active player is dealt 10 cards and the remaining two form the skat. Each hand begins with an auction. The winner of the bidding becomes the declarer, and plays alone against the other two players in partnership. The declarer has the right to use the two skat cards to make a better hand, and to choose the trump suit. Some cards have point values, and the total number of card points in the pack is 120. To win, the declarer has to take at least 61 card points in tricks plus skat; the opponents win if their combined tricks contain at least 60 card points. Instead of naming a trump suit the declarer can choose to play Grand (jacks are the only trumps) or Null (no trumps and the declarer's object is to lose all the tricks). The value of the game, in game points, depends on the trumps chosen, the location of the top trumps (matadors) and whether the declarer used the skat. Declarer generally wins the value of the game if successful, and loses the game value (doubled if the skat was exchanged) if unsuccessful. Itis important to realize that in Skat the card points, which generally determine whether the declarer wins or loses, are quite separate from the game points, which determine how much is won or lost.
