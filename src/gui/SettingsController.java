		// games for 3 players. It was invented around 1810 in the town of
		// Altenburg, about 40km south of Leipzig, Germany, by the members of
		// the Brommesche Tarok-Gesellschaft. They adapted the existing local
		// game Schafkopfby adding features of the then popular games Tarok and
		// l'Hombre. Altenburg is still considered the home of Skat and has a
		// fountain dedicated to the game. Skat is a three-handed trick taking
		// game. It is also quite often played by four people, but there
		// arestill only 3 active players in each hand; the dealer sits out.
		// Each active player is dealt 10 cards and the remaining two form the
		// skat. Each hand begins with an auction. The winner of the bidding
		// becomes the declarer, and plays alone against the other two players
		// in partnership. The declarer has the right to use the two skat cards
		// to make a better hand, and to choose the trump suit. Some cards have
		// point values, and the total number of card points in the pack is 120.
		// To win, the declarer has to take at least 61 card points in tricks
		// plus skat; the opponents win if their combined tricks contain at
		// least 60 card points. Instead of naming a trump suit the declarer can
		// choose to play Grand (jacks are the only trumps) or Null (no trumps
		// and the declarer's object is to lose all the tricks). The value of
		// the game, in game points, depends on the trumps chosen, the location
		// of the top trumps (matadors) and whether the declarer used the skat.
		// Declarer generally wins the value of the game if successful, and
		// loses the game value (doubled if the skat was exchanged) if
		// unsuccessful. Itis important to realize that in Skat the card points,
		// which generally determine whether the declarer wins or loses, are
		// quite separate from the game points, which determine how much is won
		// or lost.");
